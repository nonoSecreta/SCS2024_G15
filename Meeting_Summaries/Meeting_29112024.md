# Project Proposal Discussion with TA

## Definition of clear reasearch question
- the central research question should differ from the control group
- as goal of the meeting, it should be clarified
- focus on economic factors is a possibility

How can the introduction of a resilient tree species in an agriculture forest inhibit disease spreading and make a forest more economical.

## Economic factors for forest optimization problem
- Consider total useable wood outcome over the simulation

## Suggestions from the TA
- introduce one unsusceptibel other species to the simulated forest
- use periodic boundary conditions to simulate a smaller forest patch in a larger forest
- analyse the steady states of the forest for final conclusions
- to save simulation time introduce a desease spreading radius as opposed to the lecture where only the nearest neighbours are considerd
- use abstract disease models and implement only characteristics
- first consider only one disease scenario and limit one disease to one simulation to simplify the model
- To simulate the time scale consider instantantanious growth of trees, but harvest possibility after a set time period
- use a consistent tree density for the model, no alternations of the lattice

## Other specific topics that may need more consideration after project start
How are the spots for different tree species determined?
- Does the same tree grow in the same spot after death?
- What is the recovery time for the tree spots?

How do we model the harvest scenario?
- Deseased "harvest" with a negative effect on economic forest value
- instantaneous harvest of forest area as a realistic scenario
- Check economic value of the forest in the steady state and the corresponding time frame as conditions for a positive harvest scenario
