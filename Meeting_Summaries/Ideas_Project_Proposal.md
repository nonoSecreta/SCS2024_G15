# Ideas for Project Proposals

## Evacuation Models / Simulations:
-	Evacuation scenarios for a skyscraper
-	Obstacles in public spaces that may contain large crowds
-	Possible parameters are the panic level of each person, number of exits, in a skyscraper failure of elevator or staircase, number of people etc.
-	Model group behavior for structure layout, such as door with pol (line forming), vision cone, stochastic choice parameter
-	Goodness parameter such as complete evacuation time
-	Simulation structure:
    - Cellular automata
    - swarming behavior for crowd can be applicable
    - arena of different floors, movement on stairs, time model for travelling down

What are save emergency exit designs for a skyscraper?

## Deforestation:
- Different types of forest agriculture (for example Switzerland with area restriction)
  - Harvest patterns as a possible parameter
- Disease spreading for example fungus, parasites (may be species specific)
  -	Species variety and patches of agriculture vs. natural forests in simulation
- Tree density in agricultural forest can vary (how close are the trees planted)
  -	Quality of wood may decrease (can influence final margin of products, may not be desirable for wood in construction)
-	Economic factors as goodness measure
  -	Is the forest resilient on a larger time scale?
  -	How fast are the trees growing, and which percentage can be harvested?
-	Climate effects on forest for future prognosis

What makes a healthy and economically agricultural forest?
